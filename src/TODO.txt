Find a way to generate algebraic tangles up through 10 crossing using the rational tangle generator and Montesinos tangle generator found in the 'tanglenomicon' folder.

Add all PD notations for tangles obtained from 'FindRationalTangles' and 'FindMontesinosTangles.'

pdToConway is using the assumption that the PD Notation is given so that the first entry in a crossing corresponds to the SW corner, and is the entering side of the over-strand. The common resources, KnotInfo and Knot Atlas assume the first entry is the entering side of the *under-strand*.
